    "In  someways  we  already  do:  every  time  we  spend  our  cash  we  are  making  an  active  choice  about  the companies we support and the practices we endorse. Today, when corporations can be more influential than entire states, where we put our pounds is where the power lies. The problem is, so it is difficult to confently make an informed choice.Conser this: the retail manufacturing industry is the second most polluting industry on earth, second only to oil. According to Annie Leonard, an expert in overconsumption, only 1% of the materials used to produce our consumer goods are still in use six months after sale. Somewhere, the value ofcraftsmanship and of provenance  has  been  lost.  Price  and  speed  are  trumping  value.  However,  the  te  is  turning.  Increasing awareness around these issues has led to a rise in what is known as conscious consumption, a movement of people who seek out ways to make positive decisions about what to buy and look for a solution to the negative impact consumerism is having on our world",
